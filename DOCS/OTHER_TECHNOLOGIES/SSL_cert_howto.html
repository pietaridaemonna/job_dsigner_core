# How to generate certificate

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
rm csr.pem
```

You will get a cert.pem (the certificate) and key.pem (the private key). This is all you need for a SSL connection.

**In the second command, when prompted for “Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:”, do not give your name.** It is actually the domain name field, so enter your domain name. Not giving your domain name will result in “domain mismatch” errors.

This certificate will trigger warnings in your browser, since it is self-signed.
