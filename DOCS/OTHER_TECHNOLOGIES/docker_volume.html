# Data volumes

A data volume is a specially-designated directory within one or more containers that bypasses the Union File System. 
Data volumes provide several useful features for persistent or shared data:

* Volumes are initialized when a container is created. If the container’s base image contains data at the specified 
mount point, that existing data is copied into the new volume upon volume initialization. 
(Note that this does not apply when mounting a host directory.)
* Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers.
* Changes to a data volume are made directly.
* Changes to a data volume will not be included when you update an image.
* Data volumes persist even if the container itself is deleted.

Data volumes are designed to persist data, independent of the container’s life cycle. **Docker therefore never 
automatically deletes volumes when you remove a container, nor will it “garbage collect” volumes that are 
no longer referenced by a container.**



Let’s do the latter approach that with a feature called “named volumes”. Create a named volume:

```bash
docker volume create --name esdata
```

You can mount that volume using the -v option:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti -p 9200:9200 -v esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data my-es-image
```
Even if you restart your Elasticsearch container now it should preserve all data.

*Note: This requires at least version 1.10 of Docker*
Memory and heap size

By default memory for a container is unbounded. If you want to limit for the max memory the container uses you can specify e.g. --memory="4g" with docker run. 
You should also set the heap size for Elasticsearch. The normal recommendation with allocating half of the memory to the heap also applies. For example:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -p 9200:9200 -v esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data --memory="4g" -e ES_HEAP_SIZE=2g my-es-image
```
