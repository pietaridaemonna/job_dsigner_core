# Commandments of programmer

## Generic


### Keep your code absolutely simple!

WHY:


### As soon as you see a bug, you fix it!

WHY:

### Single Responsibility Principle aka AVOID SPAGHETTI CODING!

WHY: A component of code (e.g. class or function) should perform a single well defined task.
     Any section of code (code block, function, class, etc) should minimize the dependencies on other areas of code. 

 
Avoid Premature Optimization - Donâ€™t even think about optimization unless your code is working, but slower than you want. Only then should you start thinking about optimizing, and then only with the aid of empirical data.
